He has come to embody everything people love about Knuckle Huck: wild, stylish, creative, unconventional, innovative, unpredictable. Zebâ€™s path took him from North Carolina--hardly a snowboard hotbed--to a scholarship student at the famed Stratton Mountain School, where he sharpened his skills. The attention from his X Games victory put a spotlight on how few Black athletes are represented in professional snowboarding, and it lit a fire inside him to start initiatives like the Slide-In Tour and Culture Shifters to help change the face of the sport. It's working, fast.")
let DustyHenrickson = Player(name: "Dusty Henrickson", age: 21, goldMedals: 2, silverMedals: 0, bronzeMedals: 2, appearances: 9, description: "Dusty Henricksen made a grand entrance as an X Games rookie, taking gold in both Knuckle Huck and Slopestyle (and also competing in Big Air) at X Games Aspen 2021, then added Knuckle Huck bronze at X Games Aspen 2022 and another at X Games Aspen 2023. Some kids are born to do it: Dusty's father Marko was a member of the Gnu Snowboards team in the 1980s and was one of the world's first certified snowboard instructors. Dusty started at age 2, was competing by age 5 and had a meteoric rise in 2019-2020 with wins at U.S. Grand Prix Mammoth Mountain in February 2020 (his first FIS World Cup podium) and at the Youth World Olympics in Switzerland in January 2020.")
